Welcome to my shiny new blog!

I love science, but I've been frustrated recently with how slow
and tedious the publication process is... Meanwhile I'm bursting 
with ideas I want to share with the world and get feedback on!
So I thought I'd start this blog as a way to give myself a more
"agile" idea development experience :)

More to come soon!
