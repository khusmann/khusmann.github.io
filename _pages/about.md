I am an applied researcher interested in reducing societal inequality by making the acquisition and transfer of knowledge and skills more effective, accessible, and available, especially for underrepresented populations and populations with special needs.

As someone coming from a background in electrical engineering and computer science, I explore ways that technology can be harnessed in these areas to collect data, solve problems, understand complex processes, and create new opportunities.

On a practical level, my work includes the implementation of programs and technologies at scale in sustainable ways that simultaneously meet the needs of the public and advance continuing research efforts.

As such, I see my interests most clearly expressed as a nexus between three overlapping fields of study in therapeutic and family contexts: developmental science, human-computer interaction, and implementation science.
